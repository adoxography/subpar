# [subpar](https://github.com/adoxography/subpar)

## Requirements
The only requirement for `subpar` is bash. It is intended to work across all major platforms.

## Usage
* Clone the repo
* Add tests and solutions
* Run `./validate.sh [command_to_run]`, making sure that `command_to_run` is EXACTLY as you would type it to run the command normally (e.g. if you would type `./cmd` or `python cmd`, don't use `cmd`)

## Defining tests
* Create a file in `/tests` with the input for the test
* Create an identically named file in `/solutions` with the expected output
